## Windows binaries

The Windows binaries are the ones from the US Census
[Website](http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_pc.html).

Downloading from this repository, rather than from the Census Website, ensures
the link still works after a version update, which usually results in a new
filename.

This particular build (v1.1.57) was downloaded from https://www2.census.gov/software/x-13arima-seats/x13as/windows/program-archives/x13as_html-v1-1-b57.zip and renamed `x13ashtml.zip`

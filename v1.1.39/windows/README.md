## Windows binaries

The Windows binaries are the ones from the US Census
[Website](http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_pc.html).

Downloading from this repository, rather than from the Census Website, ensures
the link still works after a version update, which usually results in a new
filename.

This particular build (v1.1.39) was wrongly linked on the Census Website, so the
zip file is *not* the one from the website (which also contains documentation),
but has been reduced to only  include `x13ashtml.exe`.
